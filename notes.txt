Database:
To create a new database simply:
create database db_name;  needs root privileges

To give a user all permissions on that database:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON db_name.* TO 'username'@'localhost (or server)' WITH GRANT OPTION; the grant option makes it so the user can give those privileges to other users as well.
